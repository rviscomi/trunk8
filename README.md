trunk8
======

About
-----

**trunk8** is an intelligent text truncation extension to jQuery. When applied to a large block of text, trunk8 will cut off just enough text to prevent it from spilling over.

Unlike conventional truncation that just limits the character length of text, trunk8 measures the content area for spill-over and intelligently chooses the text that best fits in the given space.

Play with the [live demo](http://jrvis.com/trunk8/?rel=github).

Usage
-----

**Default Settings**
```js
$('.too-long').trunk8(); // Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consect…
```

By default, trunk8 will add an ellipsis (`&hellip;`) after the truncated text.

**Method Invocation**
```js
$('.too-long').trunk8('update', new_string); // Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consect…
```

To invoke built-in trunk8 methods, supply the method name as a string. Method arguments are listed after the method name as necessary. See the section below entitled Methods for a full specification.

**Pre-Rendered Content**

To use trunk8 without the jumpy behavior when the page finishes loading and truncation has been completed, add an `overflow-y: hidden` and fixed height to the element that needs to be truncated. Also add a hidden class if you don't have that already.

```css
.overflow-hidden {
    overflow-y: hidden;
    height: 4.5em;
}

.hidden {
    display: none !important;
}
```
You can use LESS or SASS to calculate the height based on the number of lines that you set in trunk8. For example:
* the number of lines shown after truncation is 3
* the line-height on your page or the element that needs truncation is 1.5em

Height of your overflow-hidden element will be `3 * 1.5em = 4.5em`.

Add a dummy element that is used by trunk8 to calculate the truncation (as this doesn't work on elements with `overflow-y: hidden`)
```html
<p class="overflow-hidden">Very long text</p>
<p class="truncate hidden"></p>
```

Set the overflow-hidden element in the trunk8 settings
```js
var options = {
    usePreRenderElement: true,
    preRenderElement: $('p.overflow-hidden');
}
$('p.truncate').trunk8(options);
```

**Custom Settings**
```js
$('.too-long').trunk8({
    fill: '[snip]',
    side: 'center'
}); // Lorem ipsum dol[snip]id est laborum.
```

You may change the settings at any time by passing an object to trunk8. In the example above, the filler text is overwritten from an ellipsis to a custom string and the placement of the truncation is overwritten from the right side to the center. Continue reading the section below for a full list of customizable settings.

Settings
--------

* **fill** _(Default: '`&hellip;`')_ The string to insert in place of the omitted text. This value may include HTML.
* **lines** _(Default: `1`)_ The number of lines of text-wrap to tolerate before truncating. This value must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
* **side** _(Default: `'right'`)_ The side of the text from which to truncate. Valid values include `'center'`, `'left'`, and `'right'`.
* **tooltip** _(Default: `true`)_ When true, the `title` attribute of the targeted HTML element will be set to the original, untruncated string. Valid values include `true` and `false`.
* **width** _(Default: `'auto'`)_ The width, in characters, of the desired text. When set to `'auto'`, trunk8 will maximize the amount of text without spilling over.
* **parseHTML** _(Default: `'false'`)_ When true, parse and save html structure and restore structure in the truncated text.
* **usePreRenderElement** _(Default: `'false'`)_ When true, enable pre-render functionality.
* **preRenderElement** _(Default: `'undefined'`)_ When set, this is the element that contains the content and will be updated with the truncated content once it's done.
* **onTruncate** _(Callback)_: Called after truncation is completed.

Public Methods
-------

**[Constructor]**
Initializes the settings and immediately truncates the targeted HTML element. This method is called when arguments are omitted and when the first argument is an object. When supplied with an object, trunk8 will merge the user-defined settings with the predefined settings object and immediately truncate the targeted HTML element with the custom settings.

```js
/* default settings */
$('.too-long').trunk8();

/* custom settings */
$('.too-long').trunk8({
   lines: 2
});
```

**update**
Updates the text value of the targeted HTML elements while maintaining truncation.

```js
/* Truncate the original text. */
$('.too-long').trunk8(); // Lorem ipsum...

/* Define the new text. */
var new_string = 'Torquent sollicitudin.';

/* Truncate the new text. */
$('.too-long').trunk8('update', new_string); // Torquent so...
```

**revert**
Reverts the text value of the targeted HTML elements to their untruncated states.

```js
$('.too-long').trunk8('revert'); // Torquent sollicitudin.
```

**getSettings**
Returns an object representation of the settings currently in effect. Because a return value is expected, this method does not promote the jQuery pattern of method chaining:

```js
/* good */
var setings = $('.too-long').trunk8('getSettings'); // {...}

/* bad */
$('.too-long').trunk8('getSettings').addClass('wrong'); // error
```
